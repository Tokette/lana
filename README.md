Lana
=====
A quick program that will be able to quickly and easily make a class schedule for you to use in college.

## What, or who, is Lana?
Lana is a Lovely Analytical Networking Associate. It can make your schedule for you, which you _should_ be able to do, but I suppose it's fine that you don't want to. Honestly, I _**definitely**_ wouldn't want to. That's... kind of why I'm making this in the first place. That, and someone jokingly said, "Hey, you should make a program that creates a class schedule for you." That's so crazy it just might work.
